      <img id="image" alt="Cribbage Game Image" src="Cribbage_help.png">
      <p>Cribbage is a card game played in a series of rounds, traditionally with two players, until one player moves
         a peg around the cribbage board twice (standard cribbage board - 121 points). In this cribbage game, you play
         the computer instead of a human opponent. Blue is the computer, red is the player.</p>
      <p>The game play should be relatively straight forward. When the game starts up, a player can start a new game,
         set game options or exit. If new game is selected, the cards are shuffled, and 6 cards are dealt to the player
         and computer. At this point, the first 'crib' holder is drawn for and a dialog displayed to the player on who
         has the 'crib' at the start.  The 6 cards for the player are displayed with a 'Discard' button underneath
         each card for the player to select two for discard into the 'crib' hand. If 'Discard' is selected, the button
         text changes to 'Keep'. The 'Keep' allows the player to change their mind about a card chosen for discard.
         Once two, and only two cards are selected to discard, the 'Continue' button is enabled.</p>
      <p>By selecting the 'Continue' button, a player discards the selected cards into the 'crib' hand and game play starts
         with another card being dealt as an up-card. Note: If during game play start, the up-card dealt is a 'jack',
         then the 'crib' holder gets two points. The remaining four (4) cards in the players hand are displayed to
         them with the button text now showing 'Play'. When it is the players turn, they can either choose the 'go' button
         or one of the 'Play' buttons to play a card. You can only select the 'go' button if you have no play to make
         (that is, you don't have a card that doesn't take the played cards value tally over 31 points). During game
         play, if a <a href="#playscoring">score</a> is made by either side, a dialog will pop up with a summary of the
         scores made.</p>
      <p>At any time, the 'new game' button can be pressed to start a new game before the current game is completed.</p>
      <p>Once the game play is completed and all cards have been played, then <a href="#scoring">scoring</a> begins.
         Depending on who scores first, the player will see either the score entry dialog or a dialog informing the
         player what the computer has. With these dialogs, the associated card hand is displayed to the player. If
         the player holds the 'crib' hand, then those cards and the score entry dialog are shown after the hand score
         is displayed and entered.</p>
      <p>This continues until one player or the other gets to 121 points. At this time (which may happen during any
         score opportunity), the game wipes all of the cards being displayed off the board and disables all but the
         'new game', 'options' and 'exit' buttons. If playing a cribbage match, the winning player will get 1 or more
         match points. If the winner reaches the winning match point value, they also win the match. If not, a new
         game should be started to continue the match until one player or the other wins.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="bold"><a id="rules">Rules</a></div>
    <div>
      <p>At the start of each round, each player gets six (6) cards of which they will pick two (2) cards to discard
         into the 'crib' hand leaving them with four (4) cards to play the hand with. After the crib is discarded
         into, a card is turned up (the rounds up-card) and the round begins with the player holding the 'crib' hand
         starting by playing one of their four cards. Game play continues with each player taking turns playing a card
         until all of the cards are played. Note though that during a hand, you may not be able to play a card because
         the total of the cards played makes more than 31 points. In which case the player who played last card gets
         one point and the played cards are cleared from the table, resetting the tally. During game play, it is
         possible to make other <a href="#playscoring">scores</a>.</p>
      <p>After all of the cards are played from both players hands, the hands are then <a href="#scoring">scored</a>
         starting with the player who does not hold the 'crib' hand. The other player then scores their hand and the
         'crib' hand. At any point during this scoring round if one player or the other makes 121 points, the game
         is over. When scoring the hands at this stage, the up-card is included within the hand as an additional card.
         New hands are dealt to both players if neither has reached 121 points starting a new round with the other player
         getting the 'crib' hand.</p>
      <p>If the 'match points' <a href="#options">option</a> is checked, a cribbage match is played (typically 3, 5 or 7
         match points) which could be double the match points of games or less if skunk points are won. Additional match
         point(s) can be gotten by 'skunking' the opponent. A skunk is counted if the losing player has less than 91
         points when the winning player gets to 121. If not playing with the match points option turned on, skunks are
         ignored. With the 'match points' option, the winning number of match points can be set and the game will let the
         player know once either they or the computer has won the match. It is up to the player to keep starting new
         games until the match has been won. Double and triple skunk points can be scored if the option for 'double/triple
         skunks scored' is checked. A double skunk is scored with 3 additional match points if the losing player has less
         than 61 points. A triple skunk is scored with 7 additional match points if the losing player has less than 31
         points. A triple skunk will be an automatic win for a standard match played to 7 points or less.</p>
      <ul>
        <li id="linone"><div id="bold">Play Hints:</div>
        <li>When determining what cards to discard, you should keep the hand that without the up-card gives the biggest
         score possible. All that the up-card can do then is make your score better. Sometimes you can get lucky
         guessing what the up-card might be, but overall, you should keep the hand that will give the biggest return
         not depending on the up-card.
        <li>If at all possible, do not play a five as your first card. It is too easy for the opponent to make 15 when
         a five is played first.
        <li>When determining what card to play next, play the card that will give you points. If not, try to play a card
         that will not give a point advantage to the opponent.</p>
      </ul>

    <div>
      <p>Scoring a cribbage hand is not difficult, though it is possible to miss points. Note that there are some
         differences to the hand scores depending on if a players hand is being scored or the 'crib' hand is being
         scored. The following table contains the combinations and the scores possible by each one (note for point
         values, face cards count as 10 points).</p>

      <ul>
        <li id="linone"><div id="bold">Other Items:</div>
        <li>Note: it is possible (bad luck) to have a hand that has no points in it. There is a better chance that the
            'crib' hand may have no points in it.
        <li>If points are missed, the computer will call you on it and score (for itself) the difference. This is known
            as 'Muggins'. The computer will not miss points so the player will not have this opportunity.

      <p>Scores that can be gotten during game play are similar to hand <a href="#scoring">scoring</a>. The following
         table illustrates the scores that can be had. More than one of these could possibly be gotten and if so, then
         multiple dialogs will display the different items that made scores. Note: for point scores, face cards (jacks,
         queens, kings) count as 10 points. Also note, the up-card is not used for scoring during game play.</p>
      <div id="tableplace">

    </div>
    <div id="bold"><a id="options">Options</a></div>
      <p>There are a few options that can be set by the player.  Options are set by selecting the 'options' button,
         then setting the option desired in the dialog.  Press OK to save, cancel to quit without saving the options.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prompts On - If checked, turns on a yes/no prompt if the new game button or exit button is selected and
            current game isn't over yet. Also prompts if match play is on and the current match has not been won yet
            when the exit button has been pushed.
        <li>Human Player Always Starts - If checked, the crib hand is always given to the player first, never the computer.
        <li>Crib Board Sounds On - If checked, peg moves make a clicking sound when being moved within the cribbage board.
        <li>Card Back Image - Select an image to display when a card back image is needed (the up-card position).  The
            image selected is displayed for preview within the dialog. Only one of the images in the list can be selected.
        <li>Match Points - Instead of 'Games Won' showing, 'Match Points' is displayed.  Also, match points allow for
            the skunk rule to give an additional match point (or multiple if double/triple skunk turned on).
        <li>Match Points for Win - Number of match points needed to win the match. Value could be from 3 - 99 and should
            be an odd value. Traditionally, matches are to 3, 5, or 7 points. This options is only available and used
            if the Match Points options is checked.
        <li>Double/Triple Skunk Scored - Double and triple skunks are scored during match play. See the
            <a href="#rules">rules</a> for what constitutes double and triple skunks. Regular match play does not
            typically score double and triple skunk points. For this game, double skunk is an additional 3 match points,
            triple skunk is an additional 7 match points. Triple skunk should be an automatic win for matches played to
            7 points or less.
